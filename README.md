# ATM Interface in C

This project is a simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface implemented in C. It demonstrates the use of control structures, functions, file handling, and basic user input/output in the C programming language.

## Features

- User authentication (PIN-based)
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit option
- Basic file handling (optional - to store balance)

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a PIN to access the ATM services.
2. Once authenticated, a menu is displayed with various banking options.
3. The user can perform transactions like checking balance, depositing, or withdrawing.
4. The session ends when the user chooses to exit.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- GCC compiler (or any C compiler)
- Standard I/O and file operations

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-interface-c.git
   cd atm-interface-c

2. Compile the code:

gcc atm.c -o atm


3. Run the program:
